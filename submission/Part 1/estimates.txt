Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Amazon RDS automatically fail over to other AZ in less than 60 seconds, that means our minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is 60 seconds.

--------------------

Minimum RTO for a single region outage
Assume the outage happen with primary region, we need to promote the replica in secondary region. Assume the timeline is as below
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)

The minimum RTO for single region outage is about 1 hour.

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Same as the RTO, the minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is 60 seconds, assuming that AWS automatically failover between AZs after 60 seconds.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage
Assume the outage happen with primary region, we need to promote the replica in secondary region. Assume the timeline is as below
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)

Since the database is replicated from primary region to secondary region every single second, it means the replica is latest backup of the master.
With that, the minimum RPO for single region outage is also about 1 hour.
